# DATA ANALYSIS JOB STATISTICS PROJECT VIA SQL

## Introduction 
After completing my master’s in data Analytics I landed my dream job, however, I soon found out my job was focused on Excel.  Although I learned SQL in my master’s program, I feared losing the skill of SQL. Therefore, I decided to brush up on my SQL with muscle memory and Luke Barousse tutorial. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this Analysis is to investigate the following: 
- (1)	What are the Top Paying Job for Data Analysis
- (2)	What Skills are in demand?
- (3)	What skills are correlated with higher salaries? 
## Tools
 -	SQL 
 -	Postgre SQL 
 -	Visual Studio Code (VSC) 
 -	Git 
 - GitHub

## Analysis
### Looking into the data it appears as if Top paying jobs within the industry based off an average yearly salary are as follows: 
 -	Data Analyst ($650,000) 
 -	Director of Analytics ($336,500)
 -	Associate Director-Data Insight ($255,830)

### The Data is displaying the top skills in demand:
 -	The pie chart indicates SQL and Python are the most in demand skills required for Data Analytics. 
 

### The skills correlated with the higher salaries are: 
 -	Swift ($153,750)
 -	Go ($145,000)
 -	Shell ($125,000)

Based off further research the top three Skills associated with the top salary are programming languages that appear to be associated with website development, and Data Science Engineering. It should be noted that although a good handful of the languages that are included in the demographics of data analytics, the top 3 are more advanced skills that are used as your carrier progresses. 

## Conclusion 
Interesting finds based off the data indicate that although SQL is leading the market for most in demand skill by 44% it is not the skill that is the highest paid. Therefore, careful consideration should be given when determining if SQL is worth the investment of learning.

## Further Research
The data set I utilized was from 2023 and market increases in payment should be taken into consideration.  The data was obtained from 2023 Further research should investigate data across multiple platforms such as Linkdin, Indeed, and Ziprecruiter. In addition, it should be noted that correlation does not equal causation, and the recent relationship between job pay increases is not reflected in the data set.
